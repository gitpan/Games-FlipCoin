Games-FlipCoin

Games::FlipCoin is a simple library that simulates the flip of a coin and returns the outcome as either 0 or 1. 
The coin is normally unbiased.  However, to simulate a biased coin, a bias factor can be passed to the flip()
subroutine which will bias the coin toward the 1 result.
